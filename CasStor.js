	description : "The Staff of the Twilight Veil is a dark, elegant staff with intricate carvings of shadowy tendrils spiraling along its length.

			description : "As an action, you can target an undead creature within 60 feet that has 50 hit points or fewer. The creature must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is instantly destroyed, and its life force is absorbed by the staff, healing you for hit points equal to half the creature's maximum hit points.

Additionally, you can use the staff to cast the following spells:\n- Raise Dead once per day\n- Gentle Repose at will (requires concentration)\n- Clone once per new moon\n- True Resurrection once per solstice\nYou do not need to provide material components when casting these spells with the staff.",

			description : "When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional 2d8 necrotic damage plus 1d8 per level of the spell slot. You regain hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt. You can use this ability even if you are out of spell slots, but the staff will deal 2d10 damage to you if you do so. This damage ignores resistances and immunities."

	notes : "The Staff of the Twilight Veil is a rare artifact with immense power. It reflects the duality of death and rebirth, and the sacrifices required to wield such power. It should be used cautiously, as overuse of its darker abilities may draw unwanted attention or exact a greater toll on the user."
